# Contributing to Atlassian DC Migration Assistant

Thank you for considering a contribution to DC Migration Assistant! Pull requests, issues and comments are welcome. For pull requests, please:

* Use the [feature branching](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow) pattern
    * If you have changes that are dependent on another developer's branch, create your feature branch off their branch. Your PR should also target their branch.
* Pull requests should target the branch you branched off (master is the default branch)
* Try to keep one PR scoped to one issue
* Pull requests require at least one approval from a maintainer and all builds must pass
* Add tests for new features and bug fixes
* Follow the existing style
* Separate unrelated changes into multiple pull requests

See the existing issues for things to start contributing.

For bigger changes, please make sure you start a discussion first by creating an issue and explaining the intended change.
